# DataStructures

A C++ console application project designed to demonstrate various data structure concepts. Built using Visual Studio (or another C++ development environment), this assignment encompasses arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, dynamic memory, and other foundational data structures.

---

## Project Overview

This project covers these core concepts:

- One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays  
- `std::vector` and other sequence containers  
- Linked lists (singly and/or doubly)  
- Stack and queue implementations (array-based or linked list-based)  
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `new`/`delete`  
- Basic operations on data structures: insert, delete, traverse, search  
- Input validation and formatted output for user interaction  
- Clear code structure and comments for readability and review

---

## Features

- Prompt the user to select a data structure to work with (for example: array, linked list, stack, queue)  
- For arrays/vectors:
  - Ask for size or number of elements  
  - Populate via user input or randomly  
  - Perform operations such as sum, average, min, max  
- For linked lists:
  - Add or remove nodes  
  - Traverse and display contents  
- For stacks and queues:
  - Push/enqueue and pop/dequeue operations  
  - Display status of structure  
- Clean console output and user prompts  
- Validate user input (e.g., size > 0, correct command options)  

---

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- IDE: Visual Studio 2019/2022 (or any compiler supporting C++)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a machine with a C++ compiler (Windows/Visual Studio preferred) and basic familiarity with C++ fundamentals (variables, loops, arrays, pointers, etc).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Javi1591/DataStructures.git
cd DataStructures
